# Binary-Investment-Technically-Caliberated-Helper
### A script written with selenium to find a certain pattern for Binaray.com and purchases "stocks"  under the trading ideas of Suchira Hathurusinghe. 
This script was written in the thrid quarter of 2020. I'm not sure whether this algo is still applicable for the current markets.

Ps :This is not an executable. You have to run the .py script manually.

1. So, you need to intall python to your computer and have the enviorentment variables set up correctly.

Follow this article about installing python, No need to install anaconda though.

2. Recomended to install Selenium Web Driver.

You can find the docs here:

## How to Run
First of all open up credentials.txt. Add your email and password sepereted by a '/'. Do not add spaces.
After that and installing python, you can just run the script via idle or just double click the .py script.

## How to use
After opening the script you dont really have to do anything. This script will do everything from opening the browser to logging in to purchasing.



## Good Luck.
