# Binary-Investment-Technically-Caliberated-Helper
This script was written in the thrid quarter of 2020. I'm not sure whether this algo is still applicable for the current markets.


## Intitialization
Ps :This is not an executable. You have to run the .py script manually.

1. So, you need to intall python to your computer and have the enviorentment variables set up correctly.

Follow this article about installing python, No need to install anaconda though.

2. Get the latest corresponding Chrome Driver for your chrome version
You can get the Chrome driver files files from here:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Replace this executable (if you are using Windows) with the file this repo.


4. Recomended to install Selenium Web Driver.

You can find the docs here:
https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/


## How to Run
First of all open up credentials.txt. Add your email and password sepereted by a '/'. Do not add spaces.
After that and installing python, you can just run the script via idle or just double click the .py script.


## How to use
After opening the script you dont really have to do anything. This script will do everything from opening the browser to logging in to purchasing.
It's written to play the Microsoft Xbox notification sound when a purchase is placed. But it is commented out to improve efficiency.

ps: I got this warning after running this script all these months later but it has no affect to the main functionalty. Maybe I'll look in to that issue later, but not sure whether I would with my busy schedule. 


## Good Luck.
